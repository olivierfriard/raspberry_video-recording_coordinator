Raspberry Pi video recording coordinator

:Author: Olivier Friard

The **Raspberry Pi video recording coordinator** is a framework to organize video recording experiments with Raspberry Pi devices.

The Raspberry Pi devices (workers) are controlled by a laptop/desktop (coordinator) using the TCP/IP protocol (Ethernet and/or WiFi).

This framework is developed in Python3 and have few dependencies (PyQt5).

You must have almost one Raspberry Pi device with a Camera module installed and a laptop/desktop computer
(another Rasberry Pi device can be used in replacement of the laptop/desktop).
